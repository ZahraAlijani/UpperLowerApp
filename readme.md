# approximation of lower upper
This project contains two Ipython notebooks: 
`lower_upper_functions_experiments.ipynb` and `differential_equation.ipynb`.

## `lower_upper_functions_experiments.ipynb` 
This notebook contains examples of fuzzy sets and numbers. Some practical challenges are included with the solution to overcome them. In the following list are the most important functions included in the notebook:
- `f_A_down(x)` - function doing lower approximation.
- `f_A_up(x)`- function doing lower approximation.
  


## `differential_equation.ipynb`
This notebook contains  numerical examples for solving differential equations:
